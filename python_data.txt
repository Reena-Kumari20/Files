                             Python programming language
                             ____________________________

Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python
is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other
languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.


 Python is Interpreted: Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not
need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.

 Python is Interactive: You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the
interpreter directly to write your programs.

 Python is Object-Oriented: Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of
programming that encapsulates code within objects.

 Python is a Beginner's Language: Python is a great language for the beginner-level
programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from
simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.

History of Python______________________________________________________________________
Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late eighties and early nineties at the
National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands.

Python is derived from many other languages, including ABC, Modula-3, C, C++, Algol-68,
SmallTalk, Unix shell, and other scripting languages.

Python is copyrighted. Like Perl, Python source code is now available under the GNU General
Public License (GPL).

Python is now maintained by a core development team at the institute, although Guido van
Rossum still holds a vital role in directing its progress.

Python Features
Python's features include:______________________________________________________________

 Easy-to-learn: Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined
syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.

 Easy-to-read: Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.

 Easy-to-maintain: Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.

 A broad standard library: Python's bulk of the library is very portable and
 crossplatform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.

 Interactive Mode: Python has support for an interactive mode which allows
interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.
